# magic_builder
`magic_builder` is a (very WIP) modern C++20 library.  The library aims to provide a safe (compile-time verified) Builder API that supports arbitrary build constraint logic and completely flexible constraint information.

Although the library is not yet in a working state, I encourage you to check out my proof-of-concept on this godbolt project: https://godbolt.org/z/9vd6cT4fx
